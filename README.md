# Terralith - Antique Atlas Patch

A Minecraft Resource Pack that provides texture mappings for Antique Atlas to handle Terralith biomes. It does not add any new textures, instead it maps existing biome tiles to Terralith biome ids.

This is a work in progress so expect bugs and missing biome mappings.

## Compatibility

This pack does not work without Terralith and Antique Atlas installed. Apart from that, it should work with any other resource pack as long as it doesn't modify antique atlas configurations.
